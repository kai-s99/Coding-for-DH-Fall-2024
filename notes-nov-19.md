# Python Fundamentals
Check slides for instructions to push notes to Git
Python is one of the easiest languages to learn due to its use of more natural language, making it easier for no-experts
automates certain functions, provides detailed feedback for fixing bugs
Relatively quick
Automation might slow the speed and require more of your computer's processing power.
## Jupyter Notebook
The environement in which we will be using python
import re = import library
from collections import Counter = getting a tool from a possibly external library
filepath_of_text = defining a variable
number_of_desired_words = defining another variable
This stuff is like an intro of an essay ^
stopwords = words to ignore lol
file io:
full_text = telling the program what to do with the text
io = input/output
splitting all the text so each work has its oen line
empty list = new variable
next part is telling the program what to do with all the words that aren't stop words 
telling it what to do with the counter
final is telling it to output the stuff at the end
